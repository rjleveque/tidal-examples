    "# Spring Tides and Neap Tides\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook [TidalForces.ipynb](TidalForces.ipynb) illustrates how a single body (the moon or sun) creates tidal forces on earth that result in bulges in the ocean that are aligned with the direction of the body (both on the near side and the far side of the earth).  The sea surface is higher than mean sea level in the bulges, and to compensate, the water is shallower in the perpendicular directions.  We also saw there that the tidal force of the sun is only about half that of the moon, so it creates a smaller bulge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we consider what happens when we take into account the fact that tidal forces from **both** the sun and the moon are acting on the ocean at the same time.  The total effect is the sum of the two tidal bulges.  But this effect can create either a larger bulge (if the sun and moon are lined up) or a smaller bulge (if the sun and moon are acting in perpendicular directions.  The orientation of the sun and moon changes as the moon orbits the earth roughly once every 28 days, and so the amplitude of the tide varies constantly.  When the earth, sun, and moon are all lined up (which happens when the moon is new or full), the bulges add up to give the largest tides (called **spring tides**), roughly every two weeks.  In between, when the moon is half full (waxing or waning) the bulges partially cancel out and the tides are much smaller.  These are called **neap tides**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we show what the bulges look like with two different sun-moon orientations, and then we will plot the resulting tides over several weeks as the moon orbits."
