But for tides, what is important is not the total acceleration but the difference between the acceleration of the water in the ocean and the acceleration of the earth itself.

This means that water near this surface is has acceleration roughly $GM_m/(R_m-R_e)^2$, which is great than the acceleration of the earth itself, which (assuming it's roughly non-deformable) is based on the distance $R_m$ from the moon to the center of mass, and is $GM_m/R_m^2$.
