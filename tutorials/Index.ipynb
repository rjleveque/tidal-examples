Since Wake Island is in the middle of the Pacific, the tides here are relatively unaffected by coastal topography, which can greatly complicate the picture.  At Wake Island it is relatively simple looking...."

    "We see several interesting patterns in the tide shown above.  Over this 4 week period, we see that there are times (around 7 and 21 days) when the tides are much larger (\"spring tides\") and other times (around 0, 14, and 28 days) when the tides are much smaller (\"neap tides\").  The pattern roughly repeats every two weeks.  This pattern is due to the fact that the moon is orbiting the earth with a period somewhat longer than 28 days, and is discussed more in the notebook [SpringNeapTides.ipynb](SpringNeapTides.ipynb)."
