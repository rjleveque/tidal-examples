    "Based loosely on the example by Sam Cox on the Pytides wiki, [How to use the NOAA's published Harmonic Constituents in Python with Pytides](https://github.com/sam-cox/pytides/wiki/How-to-use-the-NOAA's-published-Harmonic-Constituents-in-Python-with-Pytides).\n",

    "This example uses the [NOAA constituents published for King's Point, NY](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/harcon.html?unit=0&timezone=0&id=8516945&name=Kings+Point&state=NY). These have been typed into this notebook below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code at the bottom of this notebook illustrates how to download the harmonic consituents directly, a better approach in general since it is easier, less error-prone, and provides more digits of precision than the published tables.\n",

    "To find the station number and the webpages for other stations, see [this NOAA page](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html?type=Water%20Levels).  After going to one of the station webpages, you will find links to the harmonic constituents and datums near the bottom of the page.  Make sure you select \"meters\" as the units and the desired time zone (local or GMT) and then refresh the page if necessary.\n",
